A few GitHub rules:
=


- ### Always pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn’t want anyone’s work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts**
  
- ### Check the Repo on github once a day before you begin writing code!!!
  
- Keep file paths short and sensible.
  

- Don’t use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
  

- Do not commit big chunks of code at once.
  

- Make sure the code you are writing makes sense(it's not spaghetti code), also make sure you 
  **have added comments to explain difficult parts of your code to others**.
  

- When you are working on a feature or just testing, creating a branch with a sensible name and work on there.
